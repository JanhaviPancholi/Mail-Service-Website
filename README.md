# Mail-Service-Website
Develop a prototype of a mail service website using PHP as the server side scripting language. Assuming that there is only one user.

The username: alex@abc.ac.in
The password: alex!23

There are 5 mails stored in an array. It also has the date and sender of each mail.



The login page looks like this:

The following functionalities are implemented in the project which works well:

a. login validation and displaying appropriate error message. It shows error message if the given username and password does not match.

b. displaying mails (from latest to oldest) - assuming that all the mails were sent in the same month and year (e.g. September 2021).

c. search bar to search for mails based on the sender.

d. logging out and bringing it back to the login page.

The code is readable and well-commented. User-defined functions and library functions are used for the project.
